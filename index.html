    <br>
    <h4 style="color: white;margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%;">Slapjack, also known as Slaps, is a card game of the matching family, generally played among children. It can often be a child's first introduction to playing cards. Note: If you have problems opening both players, the server will restart after about 6 minutes. This is because I set two sessions (one Websocket Connection) only, so for example, if there are already two pages for player1 and player2 and you refresh one of pages, the server will restart.</h4>
