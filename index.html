    <h4 style="color: white;">Slapjack, also known as Slaps, is a card game of the matching family, generally played among children. It can often be a child's first introduction to playing cards. Here are the rules:</h4>
    <h4 style="color:white;">Note: If you have problems opening both players, the server will restart after about 6 minutes. This is because I set two sessions (one Websocket Connection) only, so for example, if there are already two pages and you refresh one, the server will restart.</h4>
    
  <ul style="color: white;">
    <li><h4>2 players required, a turn-based game and player1 will go first.</h2></li>
    <li><h4>Click Deal button to play the game.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Shuffle a deck: Each player will get 26 cards randomly at the beginning.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Each player lifts one card at a time from their pile and places it face up in the center of the table.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>When the card played to the center is a jack, the fun begins!</h4></li>
    <li><h4>The first player to slap their hand down on the jack takes it, as well as all the cards beneath it.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>The player winning these cards turns them face down, places them on their pile of cards.</h4></li>
  </ul>
